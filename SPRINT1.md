# Sprint 1 Report

## User Stories

### As a User:
- I want a landing page that introduces the app and its features, so that I understand its purpose before logging in and know what it offers.
- I want to be restricted from accessing any functionality until I log in, so that unauthorized users cannot use the app's features.
- I want to create an account so that I can log in and use the application.
- I want to log in securely using my credentials.
- I want to create a group and add users.
- I want to see the list of groups that I am a part of.
- If I try to access `/dashboard` without logging in, I should be redirected to the login page.

## Issues Planned for Sprint 1
